This package provides you with a completely working terminal-like interface. If your game needs a working terminal to be a part the computers, this can help you do that. It is also easy to add custom commands to the source code.

It is also extremely easy to add custom commands to to change the variables in the game like player speed or player position during runtime without leaving the game view. It has implemented Admin access meaning, you can restrict certain commands from certain users.

You can contact me if you want custom commands to affect various game variables during runtime. Depending upon the scale of the request, i can do it either for no or a small fee.

You can also add it yourself. It is as easy as adding a function and if else in the terminalv3.cs file.

I will be adding more and more commands to closely resemble working on a linux terminal or any command line interface along with fun and useful custom commands.
